[0. Triangle Quest](https://github.com/erikaosgue/python_challenges/blob/master/0-triangle_quest.py)

You are given a positive integer `N`. Print a numerical triangle of height `N-1`

like the one below:

    1
    22
    333
    4444
    55555
    ......

Can you do it using only arithmetic operations, a single for loop and print statement?

Use no more than two lines. 

[1. Reverse Words](https://github.com/erikaosgue/python_challenges/blob/master/1-reverse_words_and_swap_cases.py)

[2. Swap Cases](https://github.com/erikaosgue/python_challenges/blob/master/2-swap_case.py)

You are given a string and your task is to swap cases. In other words, convert all lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa.

[3. split and Join](https://github.com/erikaosgue/python_challenges/blob/master/3-split_and_join_str.py)

You are given a string. Split the string on a " " (space) delimiter and join using a - hyphen.

Input Format
The first line contains a string consisting of space separated words.

Output Format
Print the formatted string as explained above.

[5.](https://github.com/erikaosgue/python_challenges/blob/master/5-counting_valleys.py)

[7. write a function for leap year]()

Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function

[8. Numpy array]()

You are given a space separated list of nine integers. Your task is to convert this list into a 3X3 NumPy array. 

[9. Repeated String]()

There is a string,`s` , of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, `n`, find and print the number of letter a's in the first

letters of the infinite string.

Example

    s = 'abcac'
    n = 10

The substring we consider is `abcacabcac`, the first `10` characters of the infinite string. There are `4` occurrences of a in the substring. 

[]()
